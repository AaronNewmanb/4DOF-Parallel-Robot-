In a world of code and bytes,
Where robots dance and take flight,
A 3D printed arm, strong and bright,
Guided by control code, day and night.

With precision and grace, it moves and bends,
A mechanical marvel, a journey that transcends,
From lines of code, a symphony ascends,
A robotic masterpiece, where beauty never ends.

In the realm of circuits and gears,
This arm conquers obstacles and fears,
A testament to engineering pioneers,
A creation that brings joy and cheers.

So let us celebrate this robotic art,
With every line of code, a new start,
In this world of technology, we impart,
The wonders of a 3D printed arm, a work of pure heart.
